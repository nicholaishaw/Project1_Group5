# The Effect of Stress Level and Physical Activity on Sleep Duration 

## Background
Research samples of the American population have revealed that as many as 50% of Americans have difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep (Crowley, 2011). In addition, other analyses report that just under 20% of Americans experience daytime drowsiness (Slater & Steier, 2012). Recent health findings report that sleeping less than 7 hours a night is associated with an increased risk for various health complications such as diabetes, heart disease, and overall mortality (Liu et al., 2016). Research has also reported the association of lack of sleep and mental dysfunction as well. For instance, Liu (2016) discusses that poor sleep habits are associated with cognitive dysfunction. Since prior research shows that many Americans have sleep-related difficulty and will experience the subsequent effects of sleep loss, our data analysis investigates some of the ways individuals can obtain more sleep.

## Methods
**Physical activity and sleep.** Fitbits were given to ????? participants 

**Stress level and sleep.**

## Results

**Physical activity level and sleep.** We conducted an analysis of thirty participants using Jupyter Notebook from a public dataset on Kaggle (Möbius, 2020). We found there was no significant correlation between very active exercise and hours asleep (p=0.066, r=-0.090). We found a significant negative association between hours of sedentary activity and hours asleep (p=1.220e-41, r=-0.599). We found a significant negative association between hours of fairly active exercise and hours asleep (p=4.877e-07, r=-0.245). We found no significant association between lightly active exercise and hours asleep (p=0.505, r=-0.033). 

**Self-reported stress level and sleep.** We conducted an analysis of 374 participants using Jupyter Notebook obtained from a public dataset in Kaggle (Tharmalingam, 2023). We found that there was a significant negative association between self-reported level of stress and hours asleep (p=1.238e-88, r=-0.811). We found a significant positive association between heart rate and stress level (p=4.492e-50, r=0.670). We found a significant negative association between stress level and hours asleep (p=6.915e-27, r=-0.516). As such, we reject the null hypothesis that stress level does not impact sleep duration.
